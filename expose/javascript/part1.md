Question 1: Line 9 prints "values added: 20" if "add" is true <br>
Question 2: Line 13 prints "final result: 20" if "add" is true <br>
Question 3: Line 9 prints "values added: 20" if "add" is true <br>
Question 4: Line 13 will cause a "ReferenceError" because of the scope that "result" was declared in using "let" <br>
Question 5: Line 9 prints "values added: 20" because although "const" variables are unable to be reassigned, line 7 effectively works as the first assignment <br>
Question 6: Line 13 will cause a "ReferenceError" for the same reason as question for because "const" works the same way
